The purpose of this app would be to find available campsites in the desired location, weather the site be on federal, county, state or private lands in the US. The types of users would be those who enjoy camping and being in the outdoors. 

A scenario for a user would someone that is busy but oversees planning a family camping trip and needs to find a group site but doesn’t have the time to look at all the websites (federal, state) but wants to reserve the right site for everyone’s needs (RV parking).

Another scenario for a user would be someone already on the road and has a planned trip, but got delayed because of a flat tire so they need to find a place to camp for the night due to this unexpected event. 

 This app would have a map and list of where the available campgrounds are. This app would also have favorites, have filters on what type of campsite (i.e. tent, RV, group), ratings, list of rest areas, helpful stores (Costco, REI), and recreational attractions (beaches, trails). The app would also have a feature that would alert the user when a campsite becomes available at a previously booked campground. The app will be supported by using databases to find the websites and campsite availability. 
 
User stories

As a parent, I would like to be able to find a nearby, day use area with a covered area for my kid’s birthday party so that I can plan to have it even if it rains.
As a person who’s too tired to drive the RV anymore and hours away from the planned destination, I need to find a RV site quick and close, so that I can get some rest and avoid falling asleep at the wheel.

As a person who procrastinates, I would like to be able to be alerted when a campsite is available at a campground that was previously booked, so that I can still have a place to go and enjoy the outdoors with my family.

As a person who coordinates family reunions, I would like to be able to find a group campsite by just going to one app where I can see all available sites at federal, state and county parks so that I can make the best choice that suites my family’s needs.
